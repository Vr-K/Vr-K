- 👋 Hi, I’m Veera
- 🌍 I'm from Finland. It is so cold here.
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of stuff, but currently trying to get a hang of school again.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning coding in general. I can read very basic code, but heckity ding dang, I can't write any to save a life.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on school related stuff for now. Maybe something more spicy later ;)
-   ~~For real though, I am here because of video games. I am sorry~~
- 📫 Hit me up on Discord. My **secret** Discord.
- 😄 Pronouns: Any/All
- ⚡ Fun fact: Help I am being carried by a giant eagle to it's nest to be consumed fully by it's young. Finally, a purpose for my ailing meat mecha <3
