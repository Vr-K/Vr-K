- 👋 Hi, I’m @Vr-K
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of stuff, but currently trying to get a hang of school again.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning coding in general. Hope the coding dragon doesn't eat me.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on school related stuff for now. Maybe something more spicy later ;)
- 📫 How to reach me, is not through here.
- 😄 Pronouns: Any/All
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am bad at this.
- Oh no, I'm boring
