Hi I'm Veera, currently a first year student at LAB University, my study track being Industrial Information Technology.
My interests include; video games, arts, movies, reading and writing. I am currently learning to code, which itself is super interesting.
I would say I have knowledge regarding arts, making and criticizing, video game related know how and all sorts of random trivia.
I don't want to say I expect from my studies, more than hope to finish my studies with enough knowledge and experience to move straight into work life.
As for future plans: Get a job build a family get a pet? Beyond all that I would like to make a something that will move people like I have been moved by certain movies, games and stories over the years. It is after all important for people to be able to express themselves in this life. Because what else are we but creatures driven to express and connect with others?
